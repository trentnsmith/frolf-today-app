# Frolf Today

If you are an avid disc golfer and live in the state of Nebraska, this app will prove most useful! With the ability to search for a disc golf course by zipcodes in the great state of Nebraska, you'll be able to find new courses every day, as well as be able to locate the course on a map. If you are looking for details about any course, click on the course and you'll find details such as course length, type of tee boxes, and a description of the course. If you found a new course that is not on this app, you can add a new course and write your own description.
